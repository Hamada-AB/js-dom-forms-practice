# Form Event Practice

## Instructions

1. Read through the HTML file to get comfortable with the structure of the elements
2. Add an event listener to the form that runs when the form is submitted
3. Display a list of all submissions in the `ul` element provided. Each element in there should be an `li` element

### Extensions
- Add form validation with useful messages on the UI (e.g. minimum lengths, email validation, not allowing duplicates)
- Add a delete button to each submission that removes it from the list

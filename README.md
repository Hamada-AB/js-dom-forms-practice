# Form Event Practice

## Instructions

1. Read through the HTML file to get comfortable with the structure of the elements
2. Add an event listener to the form that runs when the form is submitted
3. Display a list of all submissions in the `ul` element provided. Each element in there should be an `li` element

### Extensions

1. **Enhanced Validation:**
   - Implement additional validation checks for the form inputs, such as ensuring the email address follows a valid format or setting a minimum and maximum length for the name input.

2. **Dynamic Form Elements:**
   - Add functionality to dynamically add and remove form elements (e.g., additional email fields) using JavaScript. This could involve adding buttons to "Add Email" or "Remove Email" dynamically.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling to display meaningful error messages to users when form submission fails due to validation errors. These messages should be displayed dynamically on the page rather than using browser alerts.

4. **Real-Time Feedback:**
   - Provide real-time feedback to users as they fill out the form, such as displaying a message indicating whether the entered email address is available or already in use.
